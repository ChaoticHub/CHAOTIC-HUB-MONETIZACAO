❤️‍🔥 Thank you, Chaos, for all the incredible moments and even the bad ones you gave us, there were laughs, friendships, victories and defeats that stayed in our memory, every second inside this game was special, and even though you are slowly losing players, nothing erases the shine of the story you built, I wish this legacy will never be forgotten
